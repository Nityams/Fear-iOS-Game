# Fear-iOS-Game
Small 4 weeks project made during summer when I was a Make School student.

## Pitch:
Here you are hunted by a ghost in the dark. This game is designed to put you at the edge of your seat. Run and survive as long as you can in this exciting side scrolling game. The longer you live, the further you’ll run and more points you’ll achieve. Watch out for obstacles, they will slow you down and may eventually kill you. The path will get darker and spookier as you proceed. Your courage will be rewarded with magics and spells which will guide you through the game as you collect magical flames.
